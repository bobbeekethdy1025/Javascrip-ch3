Javascript-ch3 is the repository for the 3rd challenge assessment we were given.
Above this text there are two links that will take you to the repository for this assessment and the latter will send you to the live website.
Within the repository, you will find an index.html, style.css, and script.js.
In these files, you will be able to see how the website was structured and how JavaScript was used to build the password generator.
On the live website you will be presented with a random password generator. 
When you click on the button that is labeled, "Generate Password" a  chain series of popup boxes will appear asking whether you like to have your password include uppercase, lowercase, and ect.
After answering each prompt, you will ultimately end up with a randomly generated password that include all of the prompts that you had agreed to.

Thank you for taking the time to read this.
